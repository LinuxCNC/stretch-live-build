# stretch-live-build
Scripts supporting the build of the linuxcnc stretch live cd image

The images themselves are at http://www.linuxcnc.org/testing-stretch-rtpreempt/

## Current status
When run on a Debian Stretch amd64 system, this produces an approximately 1.2GB image that can be booted via USB.
It includes the 64-bit "preempt-rt" kernel, the latest linuxcnc 2.7.x "uspace" release, and uses the xfce desktop.

This is essentially untested.  It will probably let your chickes out of the coop, make your goats' milk sour, etc.

Not to mention ruining machine tools galore.

The usual set of "non-free" firmware is included, but I didn't test any firmware that requires it.
Because the non-free firmware is included, I expect the image to have generally the same wireless support as Debian Stretch.

## Items I tested:
* Boots in qemu when used as a "cdrom" installation image
* installs into a 20GB virtual hard drive, using "one filesystem" partitioning.  Installed system has rt kernel and linuxcnc package
* Boots off a 32GB USB stick (copy with 'dd')

## Important notes
* The live user's name/password is user/live.
* The screen locker (live-locker) is disabled by default.  You can reenable it by via Session and Startup after installation.
* At the live boot prompt, you can edit the kernel commandline by pressing ctrl-i (booted with bios/syslinux) or e (booted with non-secure UEFI/GRUB).  This can be useful for example to enter an `isolcpus=` value.
* After installation, root access is via "sudo" with the user's password.  You can configure root access with "su" and a separate root password via "sudo passwd root".
* openssh-server is installed and activated by default.  This means you should only run the live image on a trusted network, and you should set a good password when installing.

## Known limitations
* Actual installation requires a network at install time
* On most systems, the "preempt-rt" kernel is not suitable for software step generation
* on a 20GB virtual hard drive, the "separate partitions" method failed, I think because the disk filled
* Language packs are not included, because they caused a large increase in the download size
* There's no update notifier

## Hacking on it

* Install the depends of live-wrapper, or just install live-wrapper.  However, a local version of live-wrapper is used instead of the system one in any case.
* `git submodule update --init --recursive` to get the live-wrapper submodule
* You can select a different task by editing `do.sh`: Find the `-t ... task-xfce-desktop` line.  Remove it and replace it with the task you want (e.g., `task-kde-desktop`).
* Build the image with `./do.sh`.  Specify `./do.sh i386` or `./do.sh amd64` to generate just one of the two images.  If there's already an image there, remove it with `rm -f` before invoking `do.sh`.
* Using a caching proxy greatly speeds image generation
  * I use squid-deb-proxy and set up env.sh with the line `export http_proxy=http://localhost:8000/` to enable its use while lwr runs.
  * squid-deb-proxy must additionally be reconfigured to allow it to access linuxcnc.org.  See `etc/squid-deb-proxy/mirror-dstdomain.acl.d/99-linuxcnc` in the source tree for such a file (copy to `/etc/squid-deb-proxy/mirror-dstdomain.acl.d/99-linuxcnc` and restart squid-deb-proxy to use)
  * Other proxy choices such as apt-cacher, apt-cacher-ng, and apt-proxy appear to be incompatible with `live-wrapper`.
* Using a modified version of mksquashfs greatly speeds image generation
  * An experimental patch is available at `etc/mksquashfs-compression-cache.patch`
  * However, this will also cause a growing cache of compressed blocks in `~root/.cache` which is never cleaned automatically
* If you specify `/dev/shm` as the temporary directory in `env.sh` the resulting image can't install, because it looks for files like `/dev/shmpool/main/â€¦.deb`.  (Workaround: you can use temporary directories like `/tmp/shm` and carefully symlink or bind-mount)

## Experimental persistence
Debian Live supports keeping files you add and change on the USB drive ("persistence").  With persistence, you can keep your machine configurations and settings on the USB drive, rather than installing LinuxCNC permanently to the hard drive.  Depending on the capacity of the USB drive, you can even build LinuxCNC from source.

An 8GB USB drive leaves about 6GB free for your configurations, documents, additional packages, etc.

Perform these setup steps once as root:
* use `fdisk /dev/sdX` to add a new partition (note that the first partition labeled "Empty" is actually the live image, don't modify or delete it).  At this point you may need to `partprobe` or reboot for the new partition to be available.
* `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdXY -L persistence`
* mount it and write to `persistence.conf`: `/ union,source=rootfs`
* in the unlikely event that you have a partition lableled `persistence` for some other purpose, you have to choose the second menu item to disable persistence.

To check that persistence worked,
* Reboot
* Do any operation that will change the system state (connect to a wifi network with a password, install a package, create a LinuxCNC shortcut on your desktop)
* Reboot a second time.  If the change you made is still there, persistence is working.

After enabling persistence you need to reenable updates, by creating the file `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/updates.list` as root with these contents:
~~~~
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian stretch-updates main contrib non-free
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security stretch/updates main
~~~~
Failing to do this can lead to weird problems where packages are not installable via apt due to dependency problems.
(An equivalent step is automatically done by the installer when actually installing to the hard drive, but it appears to be necessary to do it manually when using persistence)
